# The FunKompiler

A dockerized approach to build Friday Night Funkin' on Linux.

Tired of bloating your system with the dependencies of Haxe? Use a docker container instead.

Clone this repository, get to the repository folder, and type:

```bash
docker build .
```

When the build process succeeds, you should have a built Friday Night Funkin game in the build directory.
